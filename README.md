# Fairness and Transparency in AI Models for Credit Scoring

Project Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation code for my MSc thesis on "Fairness and Transparency in AI Models for Credit Scoring". The project demonstrates the development of fair and explainable machine learning models for credit risk assessment, addressing critical challenges in algorithmic bias and model interpretability in financial decision-making.
